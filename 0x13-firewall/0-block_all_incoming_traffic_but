#  Install the ufw firewall and setup a few rules on web-01

#  Requirements:

#  The requirements below must be applied to web-01 (feel free to do it on
#    lb-01 and web-02, but it wonâ€™t be checked)
#  Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following
#    TCP ports:
#              22 (SSH)
#              443 (HTTPS SSL)
#              80 (HTTP)

sudo apt-get update

# Install UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) and automatically answer yes to prompts
sudo apt-get install ufw -y

# Set the default policy to deny incoming connections
sudo ufw default deny incoming

# Allow outgoing connections by default
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow incoming SSH connections on port 22
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Allow incoming HTTPS traffic on port 443
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Allow incoming HTTP traffic on port 80
